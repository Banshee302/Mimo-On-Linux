LibRoot Manual

libroot is a API for C/C++, it is written in C++ but can be used in both C and C++ Projects.

You can use G++ or LLVM Clang++ to compile the code.

To easily use libroot in your Project include the libroot.h file, thats in the headers directory in the Project Folder.

libroot is very simple.

This is how it works:

1) When ran
|
|- Asks for Password /
		     -- If not found, it spits out an error.
2) If Password is correct, then it runs it as root.

It encrypts the root password, called "Keys" in the libroot API.
